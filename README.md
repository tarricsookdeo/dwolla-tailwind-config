# Dwolla Tailwind Config

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to make it easier to create sample projects, and other resources by allowing Dwolla's design guidelines to be adhered to with reusable components, and styles. This is done through a custom Tailwind CSS config.

## Installation

This example project uses React with Tailwind CSS but can easily be adjusted to a NextJS project if needed.

- Follow [these](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app) steps from Taildwind CSS docs on seting up Tailwind with a new React project.
- Alternatively, follow [these](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs) instructions if you are setting up a NextJS project.
- Once finished, you should have a `tailwind.config.js` file. Copy the ,tailwind.config.js` file from this project you the one you just created.
